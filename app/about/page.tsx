        <p>
          I&apos;m a full stack developer with a background in marine biology and molecular science.
          I enjoy translating complex data into elegant, accessible web tools and love working at the intersection of science, design, and technology.

          My work blends strong technical architecture with human-centered design. Outside of tech, I love crocheting, gardening, and restoring old houses.
