        <p>
          I&apos;m a full stack developer with a background in marine biology and molecular science.
          I enjoy translating complex data into elegant, accessible web tools and love working at the intersection of science, design, and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work blends strong technical architecture with human-centered design. Outside of tech, I love crocheting, gardening, and restoring old houses.
        </p>
        <p>While I was a molecular marine biologist, I had to write bash scripts, python scripts, and wrangle data in R in order to analyze massive amounts of DNA data.  I maintained this data in SQL relational databases.  Through this, I discovered a love of coding and found excuses to code up and automate as much of my life as possible.</p>

        <p> When the opportunity arose to jump from the lab to a tech role in 2020, I seized it. I was hired as a database administrator but within 3 months, I taught myself JavaScript, the ArgGIS SDK, and React and was taking on projects as a full-stack developer.</p>

      <p> You can see from my long list of projects completed since then that I've been continuously learning and growing as a developer while handling multiple projects simultaneously.</p>
